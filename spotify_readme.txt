--The spotify file tries to fetch the "saved songs" api from my spotify account to get a list of all the tracks 
  that I have added over the duration of 6 years.
--The objective of this project is to get parameters from the user's playlist of "liked songs" such as:

	song_name, artist_name, genre, date_added, mood, dancebility

-- The code was written without utilizing any third-party spotify modules

(there are almost 700 liked songs that have been added to the playlist over the years.)

-- These params will be used to analyze the patterns such as:
	-- favourite genre of the user
	-- fav artists
	-- what was the "genre" of the majority of the songs that were added to the playlist in a given year?
	-- what was the "dancilibity" score and "mood" of the songs that were added to the playlist over the years years?
	-- how the pattern of "dancilibity" score and "mood" of the songs changed over the years 
	   and what information it provides about the user's personality.
